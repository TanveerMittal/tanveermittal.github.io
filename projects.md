* [**Sequence to Sequence Question Answering**](https://github.com/TanveerMittal/LIGN_167_Final):
  * Trained sequence to sequence deep learning models on the [SQuAD 2.0 dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)
  * Implemented multi-headed self attention with an LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, LSTM, and RNN models from scratch in Pytorch
* [**Where's Waldo**](https://github.com/TanveerMittal/Wheres_Waldo):
  * Applied a Convolutional Neural Network with the sliding windows detection algorithm to find Waldo
* [**Microsoft Pet Breed Classification Challenge**](https://github.com/TanveerMittal/DS3_Datathon_2019)(2019 UCSD Datathon Submission):
  * Trained Convolutional Neural Network models to classify 40 distinct breeds of pets from images
  * Achieved 90% test accuracy and 4th place on the [Kaggle Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ucsd-2019-datathon)
  * Group members: [Wayde Gilliam](https://waydegg.com/) and [George Pu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgenpu/)
* [**UCSD Residential College Clustering**](https://github.com/TanveerMittal/UCSD_Clustering):
  * Implemented the unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm to identify UCSD residential colleges
  * Wrangled a dataset of landmarks and locations on UCSD's campus using the Google Maps API
